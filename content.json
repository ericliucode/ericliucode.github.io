An increasing awareness of the need for environmental preservation has given rise to a question: Should the government place emphasis upon the importance of environmental protection at the expense of economic growth? Thesis​ As far as I am concerned, the obligation of every government is to establish a well-balanced development between economy and environment instead of ignoring any of them. BODYTopic​ Last but not least, unprecedented environmental problems are immediately associated with economic development decision. State​ In other words, whenever a decision for economic advancement is made, related environmental concerns ought to be taken into consideration for a harmonious system can reduce the conflicts between economic demands and ecological crisis. E.g.​ Such examples could be multiplied indefinitely in most developed countries. Many western countries, especially in the Nordic countries, prefer to conduct a decade-long research project before the extraction of finite natural resources; meanwhile, the government must find alternative energy if these resources are not sustainable. There is no excuse for the government to shun the responsibility of helping further develop the national economy while implementing effective policies and taking measures to avoid potential environmental hazards. Close​ Undeniably, keeping a sustainable development philosophy can save modern society from unbalanced development of economy and nature.","link":"/2019/01/26/TOEFL-WRITING-MODEL-ESSAY-20190125/"}],"tags":[{"name":"TOEFL-WRITING","slug":"TOEFL-WRITING","link":"/tags/TOEFL-WRITING/"}],"categories":[{"name":"TOEFL","slug":"TOEFL","link":"/categories/TOEFL/"}]}
